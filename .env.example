# It is used to configure n8n, Flowise, Open WebUI, and Neo4j instances, including database settings,
# authentication, and other options.
#
# IMPORTANT:
# - Replace ALL placeholder values (e.g., `your_value_here`, `your_domain.com`) with your actual settings.
# - For passwords and encryption keys, generate strong, random strings (e.g., using a password manager or a tool like `openssl rand -base64 32`).
# - This file should NOT be committed to version control as it will contain sensitive information.
#
# To use this file:
# 1. Copy this file to `.env`: `cp .env.example .env`
# 2. Fill in all the placeholder values with your own, unique, and strong credentials.
# 3. Make sure to set the correct permissions on the `.env` file to protect sensitive information (e.g., `chmod 600 .env`).


# --- Hostnames Configuration ---
# Set these to the public-facing hostnames/domains for your services.
# These are typically used for reverse proxy configuration (e.g., Nginx, Caddy).
N8N_HOSTNAME=your.n8n.domain.com
FLOWISE_HOSTNAME=your.flowise.domain.com
WEBUI_HOSTNAME=your.openwebui.domain.com
NEO4J_HOSTNAME=your.neo4j.domain.com


############
# [required] Neo4j Authentication
# Set the username and password for your Neo4j database.
# Replace "neo4j_username" with your chosen username and "neo4j_password" with your chosen password.
# Keep the "/" as a separator between the two.
############
NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j_username/neo4j_password


############
# Flowise - Authentication Configuration
# Set the admin username and password for the Flowise UI.
# Choose a strong, unique password.
############
FLOWISE_USERNAME=flowise_admin_username
FLOWISE_PASSWORD=flowise_admin_password_here


# --- Timezone Configuration ---
# Optional timezone to set which gets used by Cron-Node in n8n by default.
# If not set, New York time (America/New_York) will be used.
# Find valid timezones here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones
GENERIC_TIMEZONE=America/New_York


# --- Let's Encrypt Email ---
# The email address to use for the SSL certificate creation by Certbot (Let's Encrypt).
# This is used for important renewal notices and certificate management.
LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=your_email@example.com


# --- PostgreSQL Database Configuration ---
# These variables configure the PostgreSQL database used by n8n.
# Make sure to choose strong, unique passwords for both the root and application user.

# Root PostgreSQL user and password
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_postgres_root_password

# Database name for n8n (typically 'n8n')
POSTGRES_DB=n8n

# n8n application-specific PostgreSQL user and password
# This user will have limited privileges, specifically for the n8n database.
POSTGRES_NON_ROOT_USER=n8n_user
POSTGRES_NON_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_n8n_user_password


# --- n8n Encryption Key ---
# CRITICAL: This key is used by n8n to encrypt sensitive credentials stored in its database.
# - Generate a strong, random key (e.g., 32 characters or more).
# - NEVER change this key once n8n has started and saved credentials, as it will
#   make all previously encrypted data unreadable.
# - BACK UP THIS KEY SECURELY! Losing it means losing access to encrypted credentials.
N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_n8n_encryption_key_here
